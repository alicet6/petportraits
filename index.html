            I am a Louisville-based photographer with over 20 years’ experience. To help give back to the pet adoption community, I donate 10% of every session fee to the <a href="http://www.kyhumane.org/" target="_blank">Kentucky Humane Society</a> here in Louisville.

  When you contact me, I will conduct a pre-session consultation by phone to get to know you and your pets and to determine what type of photos you’d like to do during the session (portrait with you and your pet, portrait of only your pet, action shots, etc).

<p>
  The session includes up to 2 pets. There is a $50 fee for each additional pet from the same household. Additional pets may take more time and I may enlist your help in getting your pets settled and ready for your session.
</p>
<p>
  A deposit of half of the session cost is to be paid at time of booking to hold your specific date and time. The second half is due at time of the shoot. Cash, check and credit/debit cards are all accepted.
